### What is it, bro?
  - idk. I just use it to block Stack Overflow's searchbar
  - Nah, it pushes desktop notifications when Stre.ams begin
    - A popup with a pretty user pic and whatnot
  - In browser, it displays badge text for current Stre.am count

### What's the green square do?
  - Once it finishes tweeting you SSN, it shows a popover
  - The popover has thumbnails for all current Stre.ams
  - Hover the thumbs for a user pic and name
  - Click a thumb to visit the Stre.am
  - Enjoy, like, subscribe, etc!

### Why does this exist?
  - First. Stre.am's awesome, and I'm very happy to have been part of its development.
  - Programming's more than a paycheck, so a chance to kill 30 mins or 2 consecutive all-nighters -- you know, here and there -- was a pleasure. And I felt it'd also end up being questionably useful, minimum.
  - I felt push notifications would give Stre.amers ops to catch Stre.ams they otherwise may've missed
  - Lastly `var socialLife = Math.random() > 0.1 || !!void(0);`
